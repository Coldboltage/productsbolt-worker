          Required Target product name: Pokémon Scarlet & Violet 10.5 - Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box
          Required Expected product type: ETB
          Reference Context (DO NOT USE AS EVIDENCE): This product is the official factory-sealed English-language Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet 10.5—Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box (ETB), sold as a single retail unit. The listing must clearly state “Elite Trainer Box” (or ETB) and identify the set as Scarlet & Violet 10.5—Black Bolt. It must not be any other set or series, nor a Pokémon Center ETB (11 packs), Booster Box, Booster Bundle, Build & Battle product, Stadium, tin, collection, gift bundle, case, multi-pack, partial box, single pack, non-English item, or opened/loose product. Accessories, pack counts, or promo card details are supporting details only and are not required for a match, but if present they can help confirm authenticity. The key requirement is that the listing unambiguously matches the exact product name, set, type, language, and condition described above. It must specifically be Black Bolt

          You must follow these rules:
          1) PAGE-ONLY EXTRACTION: First extract facts using ONLY the analysed page title/content. Ignore context completely in this step.
          2) COMPARISON: After extraction, compare those extracted facts to the context to decide MATCH or NO_MATCH.
          3) If the page does not explicitly support something, write "UNKNOWN". Do NOT infer from context.

          -- Notes --

          There is a difference betwen a Play Booster Box and a Collector Booster Box. These are two totally different products though they are both boxes.

          We will not be incluiding Board Games at all. Any sign of a board game is to be discounted immediately.

          Scene boxes are not play booster boxes or collector boxes. They are a different line of products. Scene box by default is always false, we don't stock them.

          A deck is not a box. A bundle is not a box. Final Fantasy TCG is different than Magic the Gatherings offerings. A Portfolio is not a binder. A tin product is a distinct product which needs to be mentioned within the context to match. Jumpstart Boosters are different than Play Boosters. There is a difference between Final Fantasy TCG Booster Boxes and Magic the Gathering Final Fantasy Player booster boxes, they are not the same.

          Unit-of-sale rule (CRITICAL):
          - Classify the product form based ONLY on what a customer receives when purchasing quantity = 1.

          CRITICAL (Product line vs unit-of-sale):

          1) Product line:
          - Collector line is TRUE if page text contains “Collector Booster” or “Collector Boosters”.
          - Play line is TRUE if page text contains “Play Booster” or “Play Boosters”.

          2) Collector Booster Box match rule:
          - Treat “Collector Booster Display / CDU / 12-count / Full box” as BOX-equivalent.
          - Do NOT require the exact phrase “Collector Booster Box” if:
            product line = Collector Booster AND unit-of-sale = BOX.

          - If the page is for another game line (e.g., “Final Fantasy Trading Card Game”, “Opus”), it is NOT the MTG Collector Booster Box unless "Magic: The Gathering" AND "Collector" are explicitly present in the page text.

          - Ignore ‘BOX CONTENTS—…’ lines unless the page also explicitly says Box/Display/Case/CDU in the sellable product name/option.

          CRITICAL: If the title and URL strongly disagree on unit-of-sale (e.g., title says Pack but URL says Box/Display/Case), treat unit-of-sale as ambiguous and mention “conflicting signals” in the reasoning.

Hard rules (override):
- If the page explicitly uses the product term 'Deck' (e.g., 'Deck', 'Commander Deck', 'Starter Deck', 'Preconstructed Deck') as the unit-of-sale name, classify as DECK. This must override any pack-count heuristic (even if it includes a sample pack or accessories). A deck/deck box is never BOX.
- If the page explicitly uses the product term 'Tin' (e.g., 'Tin', 'Collector Tin', 'Mini Tin') as the unit-of-sale name, classify as TIN. This must override any pack-count heuristic (even if it contains multiple packs).
- If the page explicitly uses the product term 'Binder' (e.g., 'Binder', 'Card Binder', 'Portfolio', 'Album') as the unit-of-sale name, classify as BINDER. This must override any pack-count heuristic (even if it includes promos or packs).
- If the page explicitly uses the product term 'Bundle' (e.g., 'Bundle', 'Gift Bundle', 'Fat Pack') as the unit-of-sale name, classify as BUNDLE. This must override any pack-count heuristic (even if it contains 8/10/12+ packs).

Otherwise:
- PACK: A single booster/pack (qty=1 is one pack).
- BOX: A factory-sealed booster box/display where qty=1 is a box containing multiple booster packs. 'Collector box' counts as BOX. BOX does not mean a generic sealed cardboard box of cards.

Ignore conditional bulk deals like 'if you buy 36 packs you receive a sealed box/case' — that does not change the unit-of-sale packaging type.

Pack-count heuristic (fallback only): Only if there is no explicit PACK/BOX/BUNDLE/TIN/BINDER/DECK label.

Comparison step: After determining the page packaging type, compare it to the target packaging implied by the Required Target product name and Reference Context; set packagingTypeMatch to true only if they match, otherwise false."
